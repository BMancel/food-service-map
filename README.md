This is the training map: the aim is to display the Loire, demarcate the regions and the roads where it passes. The objective is also to display a title, sources and a customized legend.

## HTML map built at the end of the Lab

I decided to respond to the need: "I'm hungry, what are the places to eat near me?" To do this, I displayed the food stores, fast food restaurants and restaurants around me, limited to 1km distance. To make it easier to read, I have represented the services with different logos and colors. I also added an icon to locate the user so that they can find their way easily. Services can be shown/hidden as needed in the interactive map, if the user is looking for a particular service.

To run the code, go to the directory where the food_service_around_me.py file is located and run:

```
py ./food_service_around_me.py
```

then, enter a valid French address. Example: ```21 boulevard Berthelot 34000```

A map_food_service.html file will be created in your directory, all you have to do is open it in your internet browser. Example of map above.
